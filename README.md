# shockOutcome
Code for computing shock outcome prediction features using an example database.


This repository is structured the following way:

The main script computeFeatures.m  loads the database BBDD.mat and computes the shock outcome predicci√≥n features.

The database BBDD.mat contains 6 cases of out of hospital cardiac arrest patients with a 5 s preshock segment of the ECG signal.

The functions folder contains a .m file to each feature, which are called from the main script.

If you use this code on your work please cite the following paper, thank you.
